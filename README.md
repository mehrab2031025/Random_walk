How It Works
Import Modules: The script imports the turtle and random modules.
Create Object: An object named timmy is created using the Turtle Graphics module.
Random Walk Function: timmy is sent to a function called random_walk.
Random Movement and Color: Inside the random_walk function, timmy moves forward and turns in random directions infinitely. Each time it moves or turns, the pen color changes.
Every execution of the script generates a different pattern, creating unique artwork each time.
